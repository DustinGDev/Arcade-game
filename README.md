You will see your sprite on the screen and serveral bugs moveing from left to the right and from right to the left.
You can move your character with the arrow keys of your keyboard. Try to avoid the bugs and reach the water. When you reached the water your score will increase by 1. If you hit a bug, it will be reset to 0.
And be areful, the better you are the more eagerly the bugs want to destroy you!
